<p>
  We have received a request for this email address to be subscribed to the {{ url_base }} SCOTUS
  web citation monitoring service. If you did not submit this request, please ignore this email.
  Otherwise, please
  <a href="{{ url_base }}{% url 'subscribe' subscriber.hash_key %}">click here</a>
  to confirm you subscription.  After you confirm your subscription, you will recieve notification
  emails whenever we verify a scraped citation link.  As we know some of you may be interested
  in archiving these resources as well, we hope to verify citations quickly after discovering them
  in order to minimize the gap between publication and our/your
  archiving.  If you wish to remove youself from
  the subscription list, you are free to
  <a href="{{ url_base }}{% url 'unsubscribe' subscriber.hash_key %}">unsubscribe</a>
  at any time.  This unsubscribe link will be included in all future correspondences as well.
</p>
{% if contact_email %}

    If you have any questions or issues, please contact {{ contact_email }}.

  Thanks for using our service!<br>
