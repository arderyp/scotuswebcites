            When a judicial opinion <strong>cites</strong> something from the web, researchers
            should be able to <strong>check it</strong> later and find <strong>exactly</strong>
            what it looked like when it was cited.<sup>1</sup>

          <p>Unfortunately, legal publication hasn't fully moved into the <strong>age of the web</strong>,
            so these web citations are prone to <strong>"rot."</strong> That is, what a researcher may
            find (if anything) when they check that URL may not be the same as it was when it was first
            consulted by the judge or clerk.</p>

      <p>
        Courts cite the web, and the web is always changing. In the time between the moment
        when a website was cited and the time an opinion is published, information on that
        website can disappear or change subtly... or substantially.
      </p>
      <p>
        This obscures and dilutes the value of citations to web resources in court documents.
        Over time, these unarchived resources are exposed ever more to the vagaries of the
        web&mdash;site reorganizations, domain-name lapses, etc. The citations become useless
        or increasingly suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
        SCOTUS has begun to address this matter, but at present offers only PDFs made from
        printouts of webpages, and does so only weeks or months after the citing opinion was
        published.
      </p>

      <h2>A Stopgap Measure</h2>
      <p>
        Our system determines in near real-time when the Court publishes an opinion and promptly
        takes snapshots of the web pages it cites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though it's possible the web page has changed in the time between citation and publication
        of the opinion, this process catches the resource at the freshest possible moment.
      </p>

      <h2>A Long-Term Solution</h2>
      <p>
        As legal publishing evolves over time, we expect judges, clerks and others to use services
        like Harvard's <a href="http://perma.cc">perma.cc</a> to create an archive of any web
        resource they cite and provide links to it as well.
      </p>

      <h2>How does this work?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          our application watches the
          <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court website</a> for new opinions
        </li>
        <li>
          when it sees one, it downloads it and converts it from a PDF to text
        </li>
        <li>
          it looks for web citations in the text, then passes any it finds to a human on our
          team for evaluation
        </li>
        <li>
          if the resource is findable online when the human validates the URL, the application
          archives it using perma.cc's API
        </li>
        <li>
          users can browse <a href="/opinions/">opinions</a>, <a href="/justices/">justices</a> or the master
          list of <a href="/citations/">citations</a> found in the opinions
        </li>
        <li>
          notifications go out to subscribers whenever citations are harvested from new
          opinions
          <ul>
            <li>
              open an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/arderyp/scotuswebcites/issues" target="_blank">github repo</a>
              to request subscriber access.
