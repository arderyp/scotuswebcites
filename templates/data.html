          <h2>Analyzing Our Data</h2>
          <p>
            Our primary goal is to archive critical web citations
            for posterity's sake. Above is a graph of the distribution of opinion
            publications and web citations over time. The gauge to the right represents
            the availability of web citations as we discover them. These are simple
            examples, and the rest is up to you! Download a csv dump of our data set
            and keep us posted on the interesting things that you do with it!
          </p>
          <p>
            If you'd like to subscribe to get notifications when new citations are discovered
            and validated, please open an issue on the
            <a href="https://github.com/arderyp/scotuswebcites/issues" target="_blank">github repo</a>
            to request access.
