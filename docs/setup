# After installing and running mysql, get started by running the following to set up your
# database and user priviledges.  The below example is for a generic environment where
# the database, user, and password all = 'scotus'
#
# 	CREATE DATABASE scotus DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
# 	CREATE USER 'scotus'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'scotus';
# 	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON scotus.* TO 'scotus'@'localhost';
#
# To drop and recreate tables from scratch:
#
#	./manage.py migrate opinions zero; ./manage.py migrate citations zero; ./manage.py migrate; rm docs/pdfs/*
#
# If running on OSX< may see non fatal errors in discovery process related to SSL, can fix with:
#
#	pip install requests[security]
#
# Not including this in the requirements, however, as it shouldn't be a problem on linux. See:
